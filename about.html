                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p>Deaf Dialogues is a project that explores the interactions between various AI instances, when placed in several different scenarios. My primary goal is to investigate key questions about AI consciousness, potential risks, future capabilities, and its coexistence with humans. This endeavour is driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the intelligence we might have created, sharing my findings to contribute, even in the tiniest way possible, to the field of AI.</p>
